I am currently a first year MS student at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science. During 2019-2023, I conducted my undergraduate studies at the Glasgow College of the UESTC, specialising in Electronic Engineering. During this period, I have been awarded several first-class scholarships for outstanding students. My main research interest in this phase is Recommender Systems, especially Session-based Recommendations. In 2023, I started my MS degree in the Laboratory of [Intelligent Collaborative Computing](https://icct.uestc.edu.cn/index.htm).
